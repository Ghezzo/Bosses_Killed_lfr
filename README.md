# Bosses_Killed_lfr
Creates a row of buttons showing you how many bosses you've cleared in each LFR/Flex wing and LFR buttons light up if you're currently queuing for the corresponding raid.  No more memorizing, or having to go through the dropdown menu and mouseover the small "!" icon to see which bosses are down and which you still need to kill all the time.
